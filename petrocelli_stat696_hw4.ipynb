        "Yes, because the problem now includes time series data. The error terms are frequently correlated positively over time in this type of data. Error terms correlated over time are considered to be autocorrelated. This is often due to omission of some of the key variables that are positively correlated which in turn make the error terms in the regression model tend to be possitively autocorrelated, since the error terms will capture some of the effects of the missing variables. In the case of the plastic hardness problem, taking the same test item at 12 different points in time could lead to things like temperature variance, or different environmental considerations that may lead to the error terms becoming positively auotcorrelated because the effect of temperature or environmental factors are likely posiitvely correlated over time."
